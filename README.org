learning/teaching, research and project management.

* A basic structure for Puremacs

* Feature 
- Integrated
  + Note-taken \\
    Org-mode has useful functionalities to take notes. Quick to open an 
    file for note-taking, an Org file can be bounded to the key "F1":
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun open-note-file ()
        "Quickly open an org file for note taking."
        (interactive)
        (find-file "~/Documents/Org/note.org"))
      (global-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'open-note-file)
    #+end_src
    
    Further extended with the Org-Roam (V2) package by saving all the links between
    files and headings in a database.

- Custmisable
- Extensible
  + Customisation \\
    Nothing cannot be custmised in this General Pure Emacs. 
  + literate programming \\
    The literate programming mode, Org-Babel, is able to embed multiple
    programming languages in a org file to make it as an active document.
- Creative \\ 
- Instructive \\
  The [[./tutorial.org][tutorial]] how to build this platform is included in this repository.
