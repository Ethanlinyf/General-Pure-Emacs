* Introduction
GPE is an integrated and flexible platform based on Gnu Emacs with
around 100 packages to facilitate learning/teaching, research and
project management.

Why is "G.P.E":
- General :: The operation with all the integrated facilities is generalised.
- Pure :: The entire platform is driven by the pure Turing programming
  language, elisp.
- Extensible :: This interactive platform is extensible for whatever you want
  to, even *brew coffee* with it.

* Feature
- Entrance: a fancy dashboard
  [[./site-lisp/figure/GPE_dashboard.png]]
- Integrated
  + Note-taken \\
    Org-mode has useful functionalities to take notes. Quick to open an
    file for note-taking, an Org file can be bounded to the key "F1":
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun open-note-file ()
        "Quickly open an org file for note taking."
        (interactive)
        (find-file "~/Documents/Org/note.org"))
      (global-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'open-note-file)
    #+end_src

    Further extended with the Org-Roam (V2) package by saving all the links between
    files and headings in a database[fn:1].

  + Programming as an IDE:

    [[./site-lisp/figure/Emacs_elisp_programming.png]]

  + Plan and schedule

    [[./site-lisp/figure/TaskManagement.png]]

  + Management for research purposes as an example below:

    [[./site-lisp/figure/Git-for-research-project.png]]

- Custmisable \\
  Nothing cannot be custmised in this General Pure Emacs. For example,
  mode-line customised by doom-modeline:

  [[./site-lisp/figure/mode-line.png]]

- Extensible
  + Multiple threading and asynchronous processing
    - Scheduler for requests
    - Flexible capacity tray
    - Focus-oriented

  + literate programming[fn:2] \\

    [[./site-lisp/figure/literate-programming.png]]

    The literate programming mode, Org-Babel, is able to embed multiple
    programming languages in a org file to make it as an active document.

  The [[./site-lisp/tutorial.org][tutorial]] how to build this platform is included in this repository.

See more details at the website [[https://thethingsengine.org][Something Good]] under the ThingsEngine Project.
* Installation
To enhance the default Emacs experience, the latest stable release (28.2) is
recommended.

1. Backup your existing configuration
   #+begin_src shell
     mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
   #+end_src
2. Clone this repository
   You should install Git in your system first, as well as set your
   usename and email, the same for GitHub. See the [[https://github.com/Ethanlinyf/Git-GitHub-Tutorial][tutorial]] of
   Git/Github. 
   #+begin_src shell
     git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:Ethanlinyf/General-Pure-Emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+end_src
3. Install the dependencies
   For MacOS: 
   #+begin_src shell
     brew install autoconf automake texinfo gnutls pkg-config libxml2 --debug --verbose
   #+end_src
   For Linux: (TBU, to be updated)
   For Windows: (TBU)
4. GUI with icons \\
   Run: M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts to install the needed fonts.
5. To fetch the submodules in General Pure Emacs
   #+begin_src shell
     cd .emacs.d
   #+end_src
   Then, run the following to in a terminal:
   #+begin_src elisp
     git submodule update --init --recursive

     git submodule foreach git reset --hard
   #+end_src
   
   Maybe you need to run "git submodule foreach git checkout
   master/main". And to update the submodules, you could use:

   #+begin_src shell
     git submodule foreach git pull --rebase
   #+end_src
6. Then, open Emacs(>= 28.2) to install the needed package.
   - Yes for "Need to (re)build the epdfinfo program, do it now ?":
   - Your root password is required to install a pdf-tool server.
   - You may need to wait for a while to complete downloading the needed packages.
7. Enjoy General Pure Emacs ~
