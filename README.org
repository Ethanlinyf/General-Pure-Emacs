** Introduction
General Pure Emacs is an integrated platform to facilitate teaching, research and project management.
[[./figure/General-Pure-Emacs.png]]
** Feature
- Integrated
- Extensible
- Instructive
** Installation
*** Mac
- Install coreutils
  The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
  utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the core utilities which are
  expected to exist on every operating system.
  #+begin_src shell
    brew install coreutils
  #+end_src
  
- Update the path:
  #+begin_src shell
    # Make all GNU flavor commands available, may override same-name BSD flavor commands
    # For x86 Mac
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:${PATH}"
    export MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:${MANPATH}"

    # For M1 Mac
    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:${PATH}"
    export MANPATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:${MANPATH}"
  #+end_src
  
- Restore Access to File System for Emacs
  Add Emacs and ruby to Accessibility, Full Disk Access, Files and Folders: \\

  Emacs.app actually launches using a ruby script. As a result, MacOS
  Catalina/Monterey uses the permissions set for ruby, not the permissions for
  Emacs.app. Solved the problem by granting Full Disk Access to /usr/bin/ruby

  Grant access as follows.

  + Go to "System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy"
  + Select Full Disk Access from the left menu. It is about half way down in the
    menu. A list of apps will appear in the main region of the window.
  + Click the lock on the lower left and authenticate in order to allow making
    changes.
  + Click the + button under the list of software and select /usr/bin/ruby.
    /usr is usually a hidden folder and may not appear by default. If so, press
    shift+cmd+. (the last one is a dot) at the root directory to make it appear.

  Emacs.app should now be able to access the file system without any hindrance!

  The standard emacs supplied with the system is run through Terminal.app. If
  you're using emacs like this (with the system supplied or for example an
  installation from HomeBrew or MacPorts), you need to drag Terminal.app on to
  the list to give access.

  If you're using a third party GUI-based Emacs, you'll need to drag the .app
  for that program on to the list.

  Note that some Emacs "distributions" package together a number of Emacs
  binaries for various macOS versions in a single folder, and dynamically at
  runtime chooses the right one for your system. This means that the icon you
  click to start the program is really a "placeholder" that is not Emacs itself,
  but rather just starts up Emacs. This "placeholder" often takes the form of a
  Ruby script. If this is the case, you'll need to drag the Ruby program on to
  the list.

  Ruby comes with macOS by default. You can find the program by opening Finder,
  and then from the "Go" menu choose "Go to Folder". Enter "/usr/bin" and you'll
  get that folder opened in Finder. In the folder, you'll find the ruby program
  that you can drag on to the Full Disk Access list.
