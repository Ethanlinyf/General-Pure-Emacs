* Introduction
GPE is a platform based on Gnu Emacs with around 100 packages to facilitate
learning/teaching, research and project management.

[[./site-lisp/figure/General-Pure-Emacs.png]]

* A basic structure of Puremacs

* Feature 
- Integrated
  + Note-taken \\
    Org-mode has useful functionalities to take notes. Quick to open an 
    file for note-taking, an Org file can be bounded to the key "F1":
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun open-note-file ()
        "Quickly open an org file for note taking."
        (interactive)
        (find-file "~/Documents/Org/note.org"))
      (global-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'open-note-file)
    #+end_src
    
    Further extended with the Org-Roam (V2) package by saving all the links between
    files and headings in a database.

  + Programming as an IDE:
    
    [[./site-lisp/figure/Emacs_elisp_programming.png]]
    
  + Plan and schedule
    
    [[./site-lisp/figure/normal_task_states.png]]
    
  + Management for research purposes as an example below:
    
    [[./site-lisp/figure/Git-for-research-project.png]]
    
- Custmisable \\
  Nothing cannot be custmised in this General Pure Emacs. For example,
  mode-line customised by doom-modeline:

  [[./site-lisp/figure/mode-line.png]]

- Extensible
  + Multiple threading and asynchronous processing with Python
    
  [[./site-lisp/figure/Emacs-framework.png]]

  + literate programming \\

    [[./site-lisp/figure/literate-programming.png]]

    The literate programming mode, Org-Babel, is able to embed multiple
    programming languages in a org file to make it as an active document.
