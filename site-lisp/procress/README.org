* Introduction

Procress provides a simple way to indicate progress of a process. It was born
out of a need to show such progress for AUCTeX processes, but is made general
enough to accommodate other processes.

* Configuration

=procress= can be enabled for AUCTeX buffers as follows (Uncomment the
=:straight= line if you have [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight]] configured, otherwise make sure that
=process.el= is in ~load-path~)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package procress
    ;; :straight (:host github :repo "haji-ali/procress")
    :commands procress-auctex-mode
    :init
    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'procress-auctex-mode)
    :config
    (procress-load-default-svg-images))
#+end_src

Or if you do not have =use-package=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'procress)
  (procress-load-default-svg-images)
  (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'procress-auctex-mode)
#+end_src

The function ~procress-load-default-svg-images~ loads SVG images (copied from
[[https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign][Templarian/MaterialDesign]]) which are shown in the above gif. If your Emacs
does not support SVG, or you want to use other images, you would have to
configure ~procress-animation-frames~, ~procress-success-frames~ and
~procress-failure-frames~. By default these just have basic text.
